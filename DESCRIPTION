    volatility, Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall risk and performance 
    attribution (factor-contributed vs idiosyncratic returns);

    CRSP stocks data (in the data.table object 'stocksCRSP', and S&P GLOBAL MARKET
    INTELLIGENCE for contributing 14 factor scores (a.k.a "alpha factors".and
    "factor exposures") fundamental data on the 300 companies in the data.table
    object 'factorSPGMI'.  The 'stocksCRSP' and 'factorsSPGMI' data are not covered by
